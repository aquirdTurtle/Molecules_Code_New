We show that in a cigar-shaped trap the three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of a component with a small relative population can be conveniently described by a one-dimensional (1D) Schrödinger equation for an effective harmonic oscillator. The frequency of the collective oscillations is defined by the axial trap frequency and the ratio a12/a11, where a11 is the intraspecies scattering length of a highly populated component 1 and is largely decoupled from the scattering length a22, the total atom number and loss terms. By fitting numerical simulations of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations to the recorded temporal evolution of the axial width we obtain the value a12=98.006(16)a0, where a0 is the Bohr radius. Our reported value is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction a12=98.13(10)a0 but deviates significantly from the previously measured value a12=97.66a0 [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 190402 (2007)] which is commonly used in the characterization of spin dynamics in degenerate 87Rb atoms. Using Ramsey interferometry of the 2CBEC we measure the scattering length a22=95.44(7)a0 which also deviates from the previously reported value a22=95.0a0 [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 190402 (2007)].

	abstract = {Photoassociation is the process in which two colliding atoms absorb a photon to form an excited molecule. The development of laser-cooling techniques for producing gases at ultracold ({\textless}1mK) temperatures allows photoassociation spectroscopy to be performed with very high spectral resolution. Of particular interest is the investigation of molecular states whose properties can be related, with high precision, to the properties of their constituent atoms with the “complications” of chemical binding accounted for by a few parameters. These include bound long-range or purely long-range vibrational states in which two atoms spend most or all of their time at large internuclear separations. Low-energy atomic scattering states also share this characteristic. Photoassociation techniques have made important contributions to the study of all of these. This review describes what is special about photoassociation spectroscopy at ultracold temperatures, how it is performed, and a sampling of results including the determination of scattering lengths, their control via optical Feshbach resonances, precision determinations of atomic lifetimes from molecular spectra, limits on photoassociation rates in a Bose-Einstein condensate, and briefly, production of cold molecules. Discussions are illustrated with examples on alkali-metal atoms as well as other species. Progress in the field is already past the point where this review can be exhaustive, but an introduction is provided on the capabilities of photoassociation spectroscopy and the techniques presently in use.},

This can be achieved by using a sufficiently intense laser to excite a repulsive state of the quasimolecule formed by the two colliding atoms. We study a simple two-state model and compare the predictions of fully quantum-mechanical close coupling and time-dependent wave packet methods with semiclassical approximations based on the concept of a Landau-Zener curve crossing of field-dressed states. The effect of spontaneous emission in the excited state is treated by the Monte Carlo wave-function method. Calculations are given for a model sodium system at 250 μK. Strong optical shielding, without significant heating due to the quasimolecular excitation, can be achieved at relatively modest laser power. We find that Landau-Zener models give near quantitative agreement with the fully quantum calculations in spite of the extremely low temperature.},

While a variety of approaches have used a combination of attractive (red-detuned) and repulsive (blue-detuned) molecular states, to date all experiments have been predicated on red-detuned cooling. In our work, we present a shifted perspective—namely, the efficient way to capture single atoms is to eliminate red-detuned light in the loading stage and use blue-detuned light that both cools the atoms and precisely controls trap loss through the amount of energy released during atom-atom collisions in the photoassociation process. Subsequent application of red-detuned light then assures the preparation of maximally one atom in the trap. Using Λ-enhanced gray-molasses for loading, we study and model the molecular processes and find we can trap single atoms with 90\% probability even in a very shallow optical tweezer. Using 100 traps loaded with 80\% probability, we demonstrate one example of the power of enhanced loading by assembling a grid of 36 atoms using only a single move of rows and columns in 2D. Our insight is key in scaling the number of particles in a bottom-up quantum simulation and computation with atoms, or even molecules.},
